The task is to evaluate the conditional distribution **P(I|h-)** using 4 different methods:

    1. Elimination Method
    2. Sampling with Rejection
    3. Weigthed Likelihood method
    4. Gibbs Sampling
### RESULTS
![Scores](https://github.com/Artificial-Intelligence-kosta/Inference-in-Bayesian-networks-4-different-methods/blob/master/scores_image.png)

Evaluated probability is P(i-|h-), P(i+|h-) is just 1-P(i-|h-)
